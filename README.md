# Hemswap Cross-Chain Bridge

## Overview
A secure, efficient cross-chain token bridge built on Across Protocol's infrastructure, enabling seamless asset transfers across multiple blockchain networks.

## Key Features
- ðŸŒ‰ Multi-Chain Support
- ðŸ’§ Liquidity Provider Management
- ðŸ”’ Advanced Security Mechanisms
- ðŸ’¸ Flexible Bridge Fee Configuration
- ðŸ”„ Comprehensive Transfer Tracking

## Architecture Components
### Core Infrastructure
- **V3 Core Router**: Cross-chain transfer routing
- **Spoke Pools**: Network-specific liquidity pools
- **Hub Pool**: Central liquidity management

### Liquidity Management
- Dynamic liquidity provider tracking
- Configurable liquidity addition/withdrawal
- Total liquidity monitoring

### Transfer Mechanism
- Unique transfer ID generation
- Detailed transfer metadata tracking
- Bridge fee calculation
- Cross-chain transfer execution

## Transfer Tracking
- Enhanced transfer status tracking
- Comprehensive transfer metadata
- Transfer status enum:
  - `INITIATED`: Transfer started
  - `COMPLETED`: Transfer successful
  - `FAILED`: Transfer unsuccessful

### Transfer Tracking Methods
- `getUserTransfers(address user, uint256 limit)`: Retrieve user's recent transfers
- `getTransferDetails(bytes32 transferId)`: Get specific transfer details
- `getTotalTransfers()`: Get total number of bridge transfers

### Transfer Events
- `TransferInitiated`: Detailed transfer start information
- `TransferStatusUpdated`: Real-time transfer status updates

## Fee Management
- Dynamic fee calculation via Across Protocol Core Router
- Relies on `coreRouter.calculateDepositV3Fee()` for accurate fee estimation

## Security Considerations
- ReentrancyGuard protection
- Ownership-based access control
- Maximum bridge fee limit
- Comprehensive input validation

## Configuration
### Constructor Parameters
- `_coreRouterAddress`: Across Protocol Core Router address
- `_spokePoolAddress`: Spoke Pool contract address
- `_hubPoolAddress`: Hub Pool contract address
- `_initialBridgeFee`: Initial bridge fee percentage

### Environment Variables
Refer to `.env` file for configuration:
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Deployment wallet private key
- `INFURA_PROJECT_ID`: Network access credentials
- `ACROSS_HUB_POOL_ADDRESS`: Across Protocol Hub Pool
- `ACROSS_SPOKE_POOL_ADDRESS`: Across Protocol Spoke Pool
